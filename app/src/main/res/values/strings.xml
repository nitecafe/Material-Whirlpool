    <string name="aboutLibraries_description_text">This app was created in my spare time to learn about Android development. So please
        be patient since this is the first android app that i made. Whirlpool is a great community and has taught me a lot of
    things over the years, so this app will of cause be free of ads forever, just to give back to the community.
    Shout out to the author of WhirlDroid, Greg Smith for creating that amazing app! I use it all the time too.
    I reused his forum scraper code for Whirlpool which helped made my development faster.
    Below are a list of libraries i used for any developers that are interested.
        To contact me, just send me a whim in Whirlpool or to my email grhamjs@gmail.com.
        Developed by your friendly whirlpoolian, Graham.</string>
