    <string name="aboutLibraries_description_text">This is my first android app.
        This was created in my spare time to practice android development. I hate ads and so
    i will be keeping this app free of it. Whirlpool is a great community and has taught me a lot of
    things over the years and this is just another way to give back to the community.
    Shout out to the author of WhirlDroid, Greg Smith for creating that amazing app! I use it all the time too.
    I reused his forum scraper code for Whirlpool which helped made my development faster.
    Below are a list of libraries i used for any developers that are interested.
        From your friendly whirlpoolian, Graham.</string>
