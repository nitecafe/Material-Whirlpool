A android app for the popular Australia forum https://whirlpool.net.au/
The goal of this app to allow user to browse the Whirlpoool forum with the best user experience possible and in addition adding any cool features on top.

This project was created to get myself involved in Android Developement, so this is my first Android app that i developed. 

Major Features:
- Read news, forums, threads and posts
- Check watched threads
- Google Material Design
- Swipe between post pages to change pages.
- A favourite list to add threads
- Dark Theme
